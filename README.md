The difference for this second A/B testing could be that we would might want the lettering format to be consistent for the same user because it might not be good for the user to see one time in small letters and the next time in all caps because they might not like the potential effect of being 'yelled at' whereas changing the color of the background would not have this effect. However also in the program, we will be using different methods to make the changes to the website.
